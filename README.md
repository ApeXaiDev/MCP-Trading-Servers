# ApeXai Trading Servers

This repository contains a collection of **ApeXai Protocol** servers for various trading use cases. These servers are built using FastAPI and can be deployed to a decentralized compute platform like **0G** or **Akash**.

## What are ApeXai Protocols and why are they valuable?

**ApeXai Protocols** are a new paradigm for building decentralized applications. They allow developers to create specialized servers that provide specific data and functionality to dApps. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Improved Scalability:** By offloading complex computations and data retrieval to specialized ApeXai servers, dApps can scale more efficiently.
- **Enhanced Security:** ApeXai servers can be deployed in secure enclaves, protecting sensitive data and computations from unauthorized access.
- **Increased Flexibility:** ApeXai services can be easily customized and updated to meet the evolving needs of dApps.
- **Quantum-Safe Compute:** ApeXai servers can be configured to use quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms, protecting dApps from future quantum threats.

## ApeXai in the ApeXai Ecosystem

These servers are designed to be integrated into the **ApeXai ecosystem**. They can be deployed on decentralized marketplaces and offered to dApp developers for free or for rent using the **$APEXAI** token. This allows protocol developers to monetize their work and enables dApp developers to access a wide range of specialized data and functionality.

## Trading Servers

The following trading-focused ApeXai servers are included in this repository:

- **Uniswap Trader:** Automates token swaps on Uniswap DEX across multiple blockchains.
- **Binance Trader:** Interacts with the Binance API to execute trades.
- **Jupiter Trader:** Executes token swaps on the Solana blockchain using Jupiter's Ultra API.
- **Freqtrade Integration:** Integrates with the Freqtrade cryptocurrency trading bot.

## Usage

To use these ApeXai trading servers, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Python 3.7+

### 2. Install FastAPI and Uvicorn

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

## 3. Run the server using Uvicorn
```bash
uvicorn mcp_Jupiter_trader:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8005
```
Replace apexai_Jupiter_trader with the name of the server you want to run, and adjust the port number accordingly. See the individual README files for each server for specific instructions.
## Deployment 
These servers can be deployed to a decentralized compute platform such as 0G or Akash. Refer to the ApeXai documentation for more information on how to deploy ApeXai servers securely and efficiently.
